title: What sets Founders and Coders apart?

[Founders and Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) (FAC) is a free, full time 16-week full stack JavaScript bootcamp
based in Bethnal Green. The curriculum is open source and is iteratively
improved upon cohort after cohort - each week ends with a retrospective on that
weeks curriculum (and anything else which might come up) to help us make the
best changes for the next cohort. 

As a recent and very satisfied graduate, I feel that it's an exceptional
course with a strong set of positive values.

## Free
FAC believes that high-quality education should be available to everyone. But how's it free? There are no tutors or instructors, only 'mentors'. The mentors
are alumni from the previous cohort, so it's mostly self-sustaining.

There are still things
like rent and bills to pay for the space, and a couple of paid members of staff who
keep the whole thing running smoothly. To cover these costs graduates are
encouraged to either apply for a job with one of FAC's hiring partners, or pay
back Â£2500 to cover their place on the course.

## Peer-led learning
As the course is taught by the previous cohort, you are learning from people
who are not exactly experts - this does sometimes show, however all the
material is checked over by people with more experience. The material is also very fresh in the mentor's minds, and
they remember what it was like to learn it. They're discouraged from giving
answers, and instead guide students to find answers themselves.

This structure
contributes to the community feel - everyone's equal, we're all working
together. Difficult topics tend to be discussions rather than being taught
top-down.

## Collaboration
Collaboration is fundamental to the ethos of FAC, and in my opinion is the best
thing about it. It's not just the pair-programming, or 
experiencing working in at least 4 different teams of 4. It's intensely
un-competitive. It's never about who did or understood what first - you're as
good as your team and your team's as good as your cohort. If you've done
something you have a responsibilty to help anyone who's struggling. Bring each
other up and never put each other down :) 


## Communication
Being a developer isn't just about coding. As someone who struggles with confidence in talking
I found FAC excellent in this regard - talking through my thought processes 
while pair programming, discussing ideas in a team, working with clients, mentoring, and weekly presentations in
front of the cohort and alumni were all invaluable practice.

## Working with clients & links with charities
The final projects at the end of our 16 weeks were chosen by us based on ideas pitched
to us by real clients, mostly charities. We then took on our chosen projects in groups of 2-4 and
were responsible for managing and interacting with our clients, gaining really
valuable real-world experience.

For example [my final project](https://github.com/FAC-11/AllAboutMe/) was for the [Anna Freud Centre](https://www.annafreud.org/), who asked us to continue working on it for two more sprints as a paid
project after we finished the course.

## Functional programming
At the end of my cohort there was also an after hours functional programming
book club, followed by a bonus 'Elm week', run voluntarily by alumni.

## International
FAC aims to provide opportunities to those who need it the most - which is
demonstrated both in their selection policies and also in where they set up new
campuses, the most recent being in Gaza.
