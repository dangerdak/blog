    <p>Hi, my name's Dak. I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer, currently using: Node, Express, Postgres, HTML, CSS/SASS, Git, Linux.</p>
    <p>Previously I worked as a climbing wall manager, spending my free time teaching myself web-development and helping <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/" target="_blank">10 year olds learn to code</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm also interested in effective altruism and have pledged (via <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/" target="_blank">Giving What We Can</a>) to give 10% of my income to the most effective charities.</p>
